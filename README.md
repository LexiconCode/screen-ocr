# Screen OCR

The `screen_ocr` package makes it easy to perform OCR on portions of the screen.

## Installation

NOTE: This package will eventually be shared on PyPI for easier installation.

Windows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
2. Install this package (e.g. `pip install -e <path to cloned repository>`).

## Usage

If not using the default location, set the path when constructing a `Reader`
instance.
